## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

- ✔️ Weather data collected via Open-Meteo API
- 🔄 Daily aggregation (Max, Min, Rain, Wind, Humidity)
- 🔍 Z-Score anomaly detection
- 🧱 Feature columns selected: ['temp_max', 'temp_min', 'rain', 'wind', 'humidity']
- 🤖 Trained model: `RandomForestRegressor`
- 💾 Target: Next-day `temp_max` (shifted column)
