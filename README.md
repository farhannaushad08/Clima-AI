# Clima AI ‚Äì Global Weather Forecast & Climate Insights

> An intelligent, ML-powered weather platform built with Streamlit that analyzes, predicts, and recommends weather-based actions across global cities.

---

## About the Project

**Clima AI** is a full-featured weather dashboard that combines **live weather updates**, **machine learning predictions**, and **climate trend analytics** in a clean, modern UI. Built with RandomForestRegressor and integrated with WeatherAPI + Open-Meteo, the app is ideal for educational, research, and real-world forecasting use cases.

## Features at a Glance

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Live Weather Data** | Real-time weather metrics via WeatherAPI |
| **Temperature Predictor** | Predicts next-day max temp using ML |
| **Historical Climate Analysis** | Insights on temp, wind, rain, and humidity |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Z-score-based outlier spotting by feature |

| **Trends & Forecasting** | Monthly and yearly analytics |
| **Custom Forecast** | Predict temp using user-defined weather parameters |
| **Downloadable Dataset** | Cleaned and prepared CSV data output |

---

## Machine Learning Workflow

- Weather data collected via Open-Meteo API
- Daily aggregation (Max, Min, Rain, Wind, Humidity)
- Z-Score anomaly detection
- Feature columns selected: ['temp_max', 'temp_min', 'rain', 'wind', 'humidity']
- Trained model: `RandomForestRegressor`
- Target: Next-day `temp_max` (shifted column)
